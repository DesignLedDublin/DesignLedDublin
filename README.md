- 👋 Hi, I’m Lisa @DesignLedDublin
- 👀 I’m interested in EVERYTHING!  Absolutely loving learning coding, I just want to ingest as much information as possible and keep learning new things and languages. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything.  Would love to start buliding things outside of the diploma I'm doing. 
- 📫 How to reach me - lisa@designled.io
